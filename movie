(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(SIGHS) Come on, Peter.
Wake up. Peter. Wake up.
Here's your suit.
Do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night?
I don't know.
Come on, Peter. Get up.
(GRUNTS)
Oh, Charlie.
For God's sake, come on!
It was freezing last night!
That's how you get pneumonia.
That's okay.
Okay, come on.
Let's go. We're late.
Your mother's
in the car already.
ANNIE: (CLEARS THROAT) Um...
It's heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today.
Um, I know my mom
would be very touched
and probably a little
suspicious... (CHUCKLES)
um, to see this turnout. So.
My mother was a very secretive
and private woman.
She had private rituals,
private friends,
private anxieties.
It honestly feels
like a betrayal
just to be standing here
talking about her.
She was a very difficult woman
to read.
If you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her,
and God forbid
you tried to confront that.
But when her life
was unpolluted,
she could be
the sweetest, warmest,
most loving person
in the world.
She was also
incredibly stubborn,
which maybe, explains me.
(SCRIBBLING ON PAPER)
You could always count on her
to always have the answer.
(CHARLIE CLICKS TONGUE)
ANNIE: And if
she ever was mistaken,
and well,
that was your opinion...
- (CLICKS TONGUE)
- And you were wrong.
There aren't nuts in that?
- No.
- Good.
Does that have nuts? 'Cause
we don't have the EpiPen.
STEVE: I know.
Hello, Rexy! Good dog.
Shoes off, everybody.
Charlie, shoes off.
It does feel weird.
(SOFTLY) Yeah.
Should I be sadder?
You should be
whatever you are. It'll come.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey, how's it going?
Mmm, just working.
Taking a break
from avoiding the show.
So, you still toiling away
at the hospice?
Yeah, between this
and the, uh, preschool.
So what's our deadline now?
Seven months?
- Six and a half.
- Ooh, coming up.
Any ideas for titles?
- (STRUMMING GUITAR)
- (TV PLAYING)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Come in.
Hey...
- Goodnight, kiddo.
- Goodnight.
Are you, uh... Are you feeling
okay about everything?
Yeah. Fine.
A little sad?
Mmm... (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, I get it. I know.
- Goodnight.
- Night.
STEVE: Love you.
ANNIE: Who's this?
That's Grandma?
You know
you were her favorite, right?
Even when
you were a little baby,
she wouldn't let me feed you
because she needed
to feed you.
Drove me crazy.
She wanted me to be a boy.
You know, I was a tomboy
when I was growing up.
I hated dresses
and dolls and pink.
Who's gonna take care of me?
(SCOFFS) Um, excuse me.
You don't think
I'm gonna take care of you?
But when you die.
Well, then...
Dad will take care of you.
Or Peter.
You never cried as a baby.
You know that?
Even when you were born.
Did you feel
like you wanted to cry today?
You think it might feel
like a relief?
(KISSING)
Goodnight, sweetheart.
(SIGHS)
Mom?
(SWITCH CLICKS)
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
I just scared myself
in the workshop.
With... With what?
(CHUCKLES)
No.
Are you done?
Almost.
So, maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz.
What do you think?
- Okay.
- Okay.
(THUDS)
- (ALL EXCLAIMING)

(STUDENTS CHATTERING

TEACHER:
So, if we go by the rule
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw,
what is Heracles' flaw?
BRIDGET: Arrogance.
Okay. Why?
Because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs
that are literally handed
to him the entire play.
TEACHER: Okay, interesting.
- (CELL PHONE VIBRATES)
- So he thinks he has control.
But let's all remember,
Sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional,
meaning, Heracles never had
any choice, right?
So does that make it
more tragic or less tragic
that if he has a choice?
- BOY: Less.
- Okay.
- Why?
- Because.
TEACHER: Care to
weigh in, Peter?
Um, about which part?
GIRL: I think it's more tragic
because if it's all
just inevitable,
then that means that
the characters had no hope.
They never had hope
because they're all just,
like, hopeless.
They're all like pawns
in this horrible,
hopeless machine.

So, anyone.
If it's your first

Yes. Would you like to...
Maybe not.
Okay. No pressure.
My name's Annie.
ALL: Hi, Annie.
My mom died a week ago.
So I'm just here
for trying it.
I have a lot of resistance
to things like this,
but I came to these
a couple years ago.
Well, I was forced to come
and I guess it, um...
I guess it helped. So, um...
My mom was old and she wasn't
all together there at the end.
And we were pretty much
estranged before that,
so it really wasn't
a huge blow.
But I did love her.
And she didn't have
an easy life.
She had DID, which became
extreme at the end.
And dementia.
And my father died when I was
a baby from starvation,
um, because he had
psychotic depression
and he starved himself,
which I'm sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds.
And then there's my brother.
My older brother
had schizophrenia
and when he was 16
he hanged himself
in my mother's bedroom
and of course
the suicide note blamed her
accusing her of putting people
inside him. So.
(SIGHS)
That was my mom's life.
And then she lived
in our house
at the end before hospice.
We weren't even talking
before that.
I mean, we were
and then we weren't.
And then we were.
She's completely manipulative.
Until my husband finally
enforced a no-contact rule,
which lasted until I got
pregnant with my daughter.
I didn't let her
anywhere near me
when I had my first, my son,
which is why I gave her
my daughter,
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into.
And I just...
I felt guilty again.
I felt guilty again.
When she got sick,
not that she was really even
my mom at the end,
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything.
And I just don't want to put
any more stress on my family.
I'm not even really sure
if they could...
Could give me that support.
And I just...
I just feel like...
I just sometimes
feel like it's all ruined.
(SOBBING)
And then I realize
that I am to blame.
Or not that I'm to blame,
but I am blamed! I'm...
MAN: And what do you think
you feel blamed for?
I don't know.
MAN 1: (ON TV) Hey, what's
going on in town
anyway, Mister?
A convention or something?
MAN 2: What?
MAN 1: Well, those clothes
you're wearing.
I talked to a guy this morning
who was wearing
the same kind of outfit.
MAN 2: Maybe it's the guy
you're looking for, huh?
MAN 3: You spoke to him?
What did he tell you?
Where did he go?
MAN 1: Hey, what's the matter
with you?
- Hey, take your hands off me.
- (PHONE VIBRATES)
MAN 3: You will tell me
what he said to you!
MAN 1: Well why should I?
Hey, who do you think
you are anyway?
(INDISTINCT ARGUMENT)
MAN 1: He came in
with the dog tags!
Wanted to know
about the address
and I told him how to find it.
MAN 3: Where?

Hey, um, do you think
I could maybe borrow

Why? Where are you going?
Oh, just like

Oh, so you're not eating
with us?
No, I was still gonna
eat here.
Well, you can eat there
if you want. I just didn't...
No, no, no. I'm gonna
eat here. I just, I...
Just be going to hang out.
No drinking?
We're not even old enough
to get drinks if we wanted to.
Well, that's a crock. I'm just
asking if you're drinking.
Well, I just answered no.
You gonna take your sister?
Uh... Does she want to go?
(SIGHING) Have you asked her?
Charlie?
(CLICKS TONGUE)
ANNIE: Charlie!
(ANNIE SIGHS)
I mean, what are you doing?
Leaving the house barefoot?
Are you some kind of idiot?
You can't roam around
with no shoes and no coat.
- I want Grandma.
- Oh.
Oh, what?
You're angry with me now?
You are going to this...
Hey, socks off.
You're going to this party
with your brother.
CHARLIE: What party?
Some school hangout
with other kids.
CHARLIE: That's okay.
No, it's not okay.
You're going.
- Why?
- Because it'll be fun.
Because you'll get to hang out
with other kids.
- With who?
- With your...
With your brother.
With other kids.
- Fine.
- Good. You're going.
- She's going with you.
- Great.
Now this really means
no drinking.
Yeah, I really wasn't
going to.

Hey, do you happen

I have really good weed.

Do you wanna wait out here

It'll be two minutes

You can draw.
Please, Charlie. I'm...
Oh, shit, look. They're

Not to everyone.
Yes to everyone. It's a party.

Just walk over and stand there

Hurry up. They're gonna

It's kind of cute, huh?
Yeah. My mother used to

Did she really?
Isn't that funny?
Please come in. Sit.
ANNIE: First there's the...
The smell of something wrong.
(SOBBING) And then the body.
Covered in black blood,
like tar.
And her head wasn't there
so I couldn't see her face.
(SOBBING)
But they were gone.
And her hands,
and her little finger nails.
(SNIFFLES)
How is your relationship
with your son?
- Peter?
- Hmm.
Oh, God. Um...
Okay, I sleepwalk.
I mean, I haven't done it
in years, but, um...
A couple years ago,
I woke up
and I was standing
next to Peter in Charlie's bed
when they shared a room.
And they were
completely covered
in paint thinner.
And so was I.
From head to toe.
And I was standing there
with a box of matches
and an empty can
of paint thinner.
(SNIFFLES)
And I woke myself up
striking the match,
which also woke Peter up,
and he started to scream.
(SNIFFLES)
And I immediately put
the match out.
Like, immediately. (SNIFFLES)
I mean, I was just
as shocked as he was.
And it was impossible
to convince them
that it was just sleepwalking,
which of course it was, but...
(SNIFFLES)
The timing was awful.
Peter and I had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase,
just forever arguing
about nothing, such...
Frivolous stuff.
And Peter always held it
against me.
And there was nothing
I can say
and nothing I can do
because it happened.
While I was asleep.
Hey! That was quick.
Did you bike all the way here?
Um, no. Actually my friend
drove me home.
Oh, uh, by the way,
Peter, have you, um...
Have you signed up for that,
uh, SAT prep course?
PETER: I'll do it tomorrow.
Yeah, you know what,
you gotta do that
because it's coming up.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

You're not planning on letting
him see that, are you?
- Who?

feel when he sees that?

Oh, no?
No. It's a neutral view

Is there something

Is there something

It just seems like there might
be something you wanna say.
STEVE: Peter...
ANNIE: Like what?
I mean, why would I wanna
say something
so I can watch you
sneer at me.
Sneer at you?
I don't ever sneer at you.
Oh, sweetie.
You don't have to.
You get your point across.
Okay, so fine. Then say
what you wanna say then.
Peter.
I don't wanna say anything.
I've tried saying things.
Okay, so try again.
Release yourself.
Oh, release you, you mean.
Yeah, fine. Release me.
Just say it.
Just fucking say it!
Don't you swear at me,
you little shit!
Don't you ever
raise your voice at me!
I am your mother!
Do you understand?
All I do is worry and slave
and defend you.
And all I get back is that
fucking face on your face.
So full of disdain
and resentment
and always so annoyed.
Well, now your sister is dead.
And I know you miss her,
and I know it was an accident
and I know you're in pain.
And I wish I could take that
away for you.
I wish I could shield you
from the knowledge
that you did what you did,
but your sister is dead!
She's gone forever!
And what a waste. (CRIES)
If it could have maybe brought
us together or something.
If you could have just said,
"I'm sorry",
or faced up to what happened.
Maybe then we could do
something with this.
But you can't take

I don't even know
if I should say.
What do you mean?
You're gonna think I am crazy!
No, not at all.
Oh. Okay.
All right, come on.
I met a spiritual medium.
They were performing
an open sance.
I know, I know
what you're thinking,
but they asked me to attend.
They were bringing skeptics
in and scientists.
So I went, fully skeptical.
And what I experienced there,
Annie, was truly...
Open sance...
They brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century.
And no, no, not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way, no.
And the man sitting
next to me
was a completely
cynical neurologist
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it.
No, I... I... I know
what you're thinking. I do.
But I... I approached
the medium afterwards
and I asked her about my son
and my grandson
and she came to my apartment
and she...
(SIGHS)
She ended up performing...
Well... She conjured
my grandson.
No, no, no, I know, I know
what that smile is. I know.
Annie, Annie...
I wouldn't believe it either,
I didn't believe it,
but I heard his voice.
I felt his presence
in the room.
Annie, this is real.
What are you doing right now?
I'm just here shopping.
Do you wanna come over?
Oh, Annie. Please, Annie.
I really think you should.
It would be everything
if you came.
ANNIE: Nice mood setter.
(JOAN BREATHES DEEPLY)

- How did you do that?
Louis, I'm going to ask you
some questions. Okay, sweetie?
If the answer is yes,
slide the glass to the right.
If it's no,
slide it the other way,
to the left.
Do you understand?
Louis, are you okay?
(GLASS SLIDING)
Are you in pain?
- (GASPS) Oh, my God!

Are you all right?
I'm sorry, I'm just...

I understand, I understand.
That's exactly how I reacted
the first time.
I have to go. Okay.
I'm... I'm sorry. Thank you.

Mine was the chalkboard.
That's my link.

PETER: Mom?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
You're sleepwalking.
I'm sorry. Is Charlie here?
Why are you scared of me?
What?
I never wanted
to be your mother.
Why?
I was scared.
I didn't feel like a mother.
(SNIFFLES)
But she pressured me.
Then why did you have me?
It wasn't my fault.
I tried to stop it.
How?
I tried to have a miscarriage.
How?
However I could.
I did everything they told me
not to do but it didn't work.
I'm happy it didn't work.
You tried to kill me.
No, I did not. I love you!
PETER: (CRYING)
You tried to kill me!
- ANNIE: I love you!
- Why did you try to kill me?
I didn't!
I was trying to save you!
- (MATCH LIGHTS)

Peter, sweetheart? Wake up.
- (GASPS) What?
- It's okay. It's me.
I am so, so sorry
for everything.
- Please, please forgive me.
- It's okay.
I can't stand
the things I said.
It's okay. It's okay.
Can you get up, sweetheart?
We're gonna try something.
I was having a nightmare.
Oh, it's okay.
We can do something.
Do what?
I figured it out.
Come on, come on.
Steven. Baby. Steve, wake up.
- What?
- Come downstairs.
We're gonna try
something together.
Come on, come on.
Steve, come on. Let's go.

Okay. So...
It's freezing in here.
ANNIE: Wait! No, no, no.
What are you doing? Wait!
I'm gonna close the window.
No, no.
We can't change anything.
I don't wanna mess it up.
Everyone needs to sit.
Come sit.
My friend Joan taught me
how to do this.
- (BREATHES DEEPLY)
- What friend Joan?
We need our palms on the table
and our fingers to touch.
Please.
What are we doing here, Annie?
Please. You'll see.
Please. Trust me.
All right, fine.
We can do it over here then.
Peter. Okay.
Okay, Steve. Come on.
I need you both
to concentrate.
On what?
Think about Charlie,
if you can.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Sweetheart, please, please.
I tried this 20 minutes ago
- and it worked.
- What worked?
I would not be bringing you
down here if it didn't.
Well, I just need to show you.
- Show what?
- Fuck! I'm a...
I'm a medium, okay?
I was
seeing apparitions earlier
and I just shook them off
and I shouldn't have.
Please, I know how it sounds,
but there's no way
to talk about it.
I just need to show you, okay?
Please, you'll see.
- I'm completely lucid.
- Peter, go to bed.
What! No, no, no!
Peter, please!
We need to do this
as a family.
This needs all our energies,
okay? Together.
- (BREATHING HEAVILY)
- All right, I'll stay.
Steve. Steve, please.
I really, really need you
to be open to this.
Please, please.
I promise... Both of you.
Please. I need you
to be open. Please.
Come on, Steve.
Come on, come on. I promise.
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay.
Okay, good.
So, I read that earlier.
I don't think
I need to read that again.
What language is even that?
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Try to concentrate.
Charlie?
Charlie, are you here?
Charlie, it's Mommy.
And Daddy and Peter.
(FLOOR BOARD CREAKS)
Charlie, if you're
in this room with us,
I'm gonna have us all
touch the glass.
(SOFTLY) Don't add pressure.
Now if you're in here,
Charlie,
I want you to move
the glass for us.
Even if it's just a tiny bit.
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Annie!
- Even if it's just the tiniest
little movement.
Okay, Charlie?
Okay.
Shit. What the hell?
- What?
- You don't feel that?
What? Feel what?
Like, you don't feel
the air flexing?
Wow! Yes!
Thank you, Charlie!
That was so good!
Okay. Now, Charlie,
what I'd like for you to do
is I'd like for you to show
them what you did earlier.
(STEVE AND PETER
BREATHING HEAVILY)
Can you show them what
you just did for me before?
- Mom.
- She's gonna do it.
- That's enough!
- What! No, no, no!
Listen,
when I did this earlier,
this manifested on the page.
I saw it!
- I saw it!
- What is it?
- It's Charlie!
- Annie!
Charlie, did you want to draw
some more?
- You can keep going.
- Stop it! Stop it!
Okay, we need to keep
our fingers touching...
- (PETER CRYING)
- You are scaring him!
No, I am not!
Peter, Peter, listen...
Stop it!
Listen to me.
There is no need to be scared.
This is your sister.
Mom.
Charlie, what's wrong?

(GASPS) What the hell?
What are you doing?
(PETER CRYING)
What happened?
(DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE)
TEACHER: Our country has had
many ups and downs
economically speaking.
We've talked
about the struggles
during the 1800s
compared to the fall of 1929,
in an era that
become known appropriately
as the Great Depression.
For a decade we suffered
through many, many hardships.
In 1929, Wall Street had been
going so well
that when it finally crashed
because of the Great Boom,
it caused a huge decline
in the economy.
So much so
that it caused food lines.
(TEACHER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY)
This is where
the Federal Government has,
or still has...
(TEACHER CONTINUES SPEAKING)

Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

(PHONE RINGING)
Hello?
STEVE: Can you guess
who just called me from school
in complete hysterics?
- Charlie?
- What?
Uh, nothing. What happened?
Peter just called me, Annie,
terrified,
crying in the halls,
convinced
he's being threatened
by some vengeful spirit.
Why does he think
he's being threatened?
Listen to me, Annie.
I have a son to protect.
What does that mean?
It means that that's what
I'm worried about right now
and that's how...
Hey, don't talk to me
like this.
- He's my son too...
- (LINE DISCONNECTS)
Oh!

This is Patrick
at the Archer Gallery.
Um, I was just calling
first to see how you're doing,
how your family's doing.
We've all been thinking
about you
and just worrying about you
and hoping you're okay.
You guys have been in our
constant thoughts and prayers.
And then also, uh, we just
wanted to, well, to say first,
if you need us to postpone
the show or push the date,
it's obviously more than okay.
And if not, uh,
we just wanna call and see
if we could help
in any way or offer...

You were pulling on my head!
What? No I wasn't.
I just came in.
You were screaming.
What happened?
I saw Charlie in the corner
and then you started
trying to pull my head off!
Oh, Peter.
I would never do that to you.
Are you crazy? Please, baby.
(PANTING)
What corner
did you see Charlie?
(SHUDDERING)
Peter, listen to me.
I don't know what's happening
or what you just saw,
but I am stopping this.
Do not tell Dad
what you just said to me.
Do not, okay?
Because it is not true.
Something is happening

Steve, uh, upstairs...
In the attic when you were
gone, I went up there and I...
I just... I really need you
to go up there
and see what I saw.
There's a body.
Yeah. I mean,
I think it's my mother,
I think, but I can't tell
because the skin's all black
and she's all distended
but the head is gone. (CRYING)
Will you, please? I just need
you to go and see upstairs.
(ANNIE SOBBING)

- Jesus, fuck!
- Okay, there's more.
What the fuck was that?
Why didn't you
call the police?
The police can't help us.
Who the fuck is that up there?
Do you remember Joan,
my friend whose grandson died?
- She took me to her apartment.
- It did look like your mother.
Well, listen. She taught me
how to do the sance.
I didn't even want to, but she
brought her grandson back
and I saw it and felt it just
like you did with Charlie.
Now, look.
This is my mother's album.
Now look here. See this?
See her?
That's her. That's Joan.
She didn't even mention
knowing my mom
and I've never met her before,
but she approached me.
She consoled me.
She told me about this sance,
and she showed me how.
Now look at this.
See this symbol?
On the necklace
my mom gave me.
It's her necklace, right?
They're both wearing it,
and they're wearing it
in every photo.
And look at that pattern!
Did you see up there?
This was painted
above the body, right?
In blood!
You dug up the grave.
It was you, wasn't it?
What?
All those nights you were
pretending to go
to the movies.
You're not even listening!
And then the day
the cemetery called, I said,
"Oh, I won't tell her
because she'd be worried."
Oh, God damn it!
Listen to me, Steve!
I know you don't trust me
and there is nothing
I can do about that.
But they put a curse on us
when we brought Charlie back.
We made a pact with something.
Something that is
in this house.
I don't know what it is
but it is after Peter.
I watched these pages fill.
All of them are Peter!
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.
I don't know what I did
but Peter is in danger...
And I started it.
Now if we destroy this book,
it will take me too.
I tried to burn it. I tried.
But my arm caught on fire
on its own
as if I was linked to it
because I am linked to it.
I understand this now. Please!
If we don't destroy
this book...
(CRYING)
Peter will...
Oh, God. Do you understand?
We have to do this. Please,
please, please, please.
For Peter.
I need you to trust me, Steve.
It needs to be me.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
I know it's my fault. Please.
Please, I need you
to throw it in the fire.
Please, I just...
I can't do it.
I can't.
I'm just too fucking scared.
But if we don't do it...
If we don't do it,
it's gonna be Peter,
it's gonna be our son.
Okay, I know this. I know so.
Just, please, please,
please, please, please...
(CONTINUES CRYING)
Steve, please.
Please understand, baby.
Please, please.
Please throw it in the fire.

Please just throw it in.

We have looked
to the Northwest
and called you in.
We've corrected
your first female body
and give you now
this healthy male host.
We reject the Trinity and pray
devoutly to you, great Paimon.
Give us your knowledge
of all secret things.
Bring us honor, wealth,
and good familiars.
Bind all men to our will,
as we have bound ourselves
for now and ever to yours.
